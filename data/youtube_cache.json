Some of these applications can be handled by using a modern wideband oscilloscope, such as Keysight Inifiniium Series Oscilloscopes, to directly digitize a signal at RF for analysis with the Keysight 89601B Vector Signal Analyzer (VSA) software. However, many times it is more convenient and economical to use a broadband downconverter or tuner to translate the desired microwave signal down to an intermediate frequency (IF) prior to digitization with an oscilloscope for subsequent VSA analysis. This presentation discusses the use of the PXA series signal analyzer as a tunable downconverter with an Infiniium oscilloscope digitizing front-end and VSA software to make 900 MHz wideband measurements.",

Electron has a standing- electric field and magnetic field at right angle (watch video structure of electron). The flow of electrons in a conductor is essentially caused by the attraction between the electric fields of mobile electrons and \"fixed\" positive charges in the conductor. Oscillation of electrons in a conductor is caused by the alternation of electric polarity in the conductor. Because of electric field and magnetic field of an electron is at right angle, when oscillates the electric field of the electron will be parallel to the oscillation and magnetic field will be perpendicular to the oscillation.This oscillation of the electron creates transverse wave on its magnetic line and the oscillating magnetic line is radiated to space.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/author/atom \nhttp://www.facebook.com/novaphysica\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/atommodel",

            "description": "VSWR or voltage standing wave ratio is a phenomenon that occurs on radio frequency feeders.\n\nVSWR, voltage standing wave ratio is an important parameter in many areas, and especially where transmitters are used.\nWhen looking at VSWR it is necessary to look at feeder and load impedances.\n\nIt is found that to transfer the maximum amount of power from a feeder to a load, the two must have the same impedance.\n\nCoaxial feeder,  twin-line feeder, waveguide and strip-line feeder all have a characteristic impedance. If the load has a different impedance then not all the power can be transferred and the remaining power is reflected back along the feeder.\n\nThe voltages and currents from the forward and reverse power combine together and set up standing waves along the feeder. It is found that peaks and troughs occur as a result of the standing waves. These peaks and troughs can rise to twice the voltage of current for a complete mismatch, i.e. infinity to 1 VSWR.\n\nFor lesser values of VSWR, the plot of voltage against current along the feeder is less marked.\nAccordingly it is possible to defined the voltage standing wave ratio, VSWR as the maximum voltage divided by the minimum voltage.\nThe reflection coefficient is also a very useful quantity when looking at VSWR. This is the voltage of the forward waveform divided by the voltage of the reflected waveform. It is also possible to obtain the VSWR from a knowledge of the forward and reflected powers. These are all described in the video.\n\nMore information about Voltage Standing Wave Ratio, VSWR can be found at: https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/vswr-return-loss/what-is-vswr.php\n\nUseful mathematical summary of standing waves & it includes the reason why peaks are half a wavelength apart: https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Electrical_Engineering/Electro-Optics/Book%3A_Electromagnetics_I_(Ellingson)/03%3A_Transmission_Lines/3.13%3A_Standing_Waves\n\nWebsite: https://www.electronics-notes.com\n\nPlease subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/electronicsnotes?sub_confirmation=1\ns",

            "description": "Yonatan Cohen (Quantum Machines) presenting at Interlligent UK's 2019 RF Design Seminar.  Quantum mechanics, which was born at the beginning of the 20th century and revolutionized our understanding of nature, implies that nature is far more counter intuitive and far richer than anyone could have imagined before. In the 1980\u2019s, physicists understood that this richness of nature can be used to construct a new kind of computer that can outperform any classical computer that ignores the quantum world. In the several decades that followed, physicists have made huge progress in learning how to design and control quantum systems, and have turned the once far away dream of a large scale quantum computer, into a realistic and closer than ever prospect. Interestingly, in many of today\u2019s leading implementations of quantum computers, communicating with and controlling of quantum hardware is done using state of the art microwave and RF technologies.\r\n\nThis presentation looks at at the basic principles on which quantum computers work and how  quantum computers beat classical computers.  It also considers how quantum computers can be built and how microwave and RF technology plays an essential role in the field.",

            "description": "Full details of how a crystal radio works, right down to the electron level.\n\nWe start with a demonstration of all the parts in action, showing how the radio waves interact with the antenna and antenna coil to produce a fluctuating magnetic field, which induces electron flow in the tuning coil, which works with the tuning capacitor, which is followed by the diode and crystal earpiece. We talk about why a leaky germanium diode is needed with this particular circuit or how a bypass resistor can be used instead.\n\nThat's followed by how the tuning is done using a tuning coil in parallel with a tuning capacitor, which together are tuned to a resonant frequency the same as the radio frequency by adjusting the coil's inductance and the capacitor's capacitance.\n\nThen we show how a radio wave is formed from a microphone's audio wave using amplitude modulation (AM). This then shows how the diode is necessary for converting the radio wave back to an audio wave for use by the earpiece or speaker.\n\nNext we discuss selectivity versus sensitivity and why a separate antenna coil is used.\n\nAn finally we show a few other crystal radio circuits.\n\nThanks to the following for reviewing development versions of this video:\n\nSlovenija12345 of http://www.youtube.com/user/Slovenija12345\n\nand\n\nCharles Wenzel of http://www.techlib.com/electronics/crystal.html\n\nSee also...\n\nHow to Make/Build a Crystal Radio video, the radio explained in this video:\nhttp://youtu.be/VqdcU9ULAlA\n\nCrystal Radio Troubleshooting and Tips video:\nhttp://youtu.be/HZZmKZJrIW0\n\nHow to Make an Amplifier for a Crystal Radio Earpiece video:\nhttp://youtu.be/cQ-LxMDrD_o\n\nMake a Crystal Radio Coil with Taps video:\nhttp://youtu.be/Gi9EmhrcfIg\n\nThere's also a crystal radio page on my website:\nhttp://rimstar.org/equip/crystal_radios.htm\n\n3D modelling and 3D animation done using Blender 2.63.\n\nTo follow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/RimStarz\n\nhttp://rimstar.org",

The tall radio tower isn\u2019t actually an antenna but something to elevate the antenna.\n\n3:50 Check out the FCC spectrum allocation chart\nhttps://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/2003-allochrt.pdf \n\n4:10 RF communication is useful when we want to communicate and it doesn\u2019t make sense to run a cable to that device\n\n4:50 When you tune your radio into a frequency, you are tuning to a center frequency. The center frequency is then down converted into the audible range\n\n6:30 Check out Mike\u2019s blog on how signal modulation works:\nhttps://community.keysight.com/community/keysight-blogs/oscilloscopes/blog/2017/06/20/how-signal-modulation-works \n\n7:00 Communication is just one application. RADAR also is a very impactful RF application.\n\n8:10 The principles between RF and DC or digital use models are very similar, but the nomenclature tends to be different.\nBandwidth for oscilloscopes means DC up to a frequency, but for RF it means the analysis bandwidth around a center frequency\n\n9:22 Cellular and FCC allocation chart will talk about channels. \nChannel in the RF domain refers to frequency ranges, but in the DC domain it typically refers to an input\n\n10:25 Basic RF block diagram:\nFirst, there\u2019s an input from an FPGA or sensor. Then, that signal gets mixed with a local oscillator (LO). That then connects to a transmission medium, like a fiber optic cable or through the air.\nCable TV is an RF signal that is cabled, not wireless.\nThen, the transmitted signal connects to an RF downcoverter, which is essentially just another mixer, and into a processing block.\n\n13:50 Tesla created a remote control boat and pretended it was voice controlled.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_control \n\n15:30 Does the military arena influence consumer electronics, or does the consumer electronics industry influence the military technology?\n\n16:00 GPS is a great example of military technology moving into consumer electronics \n\n17:00 IoT (internet of things) is also driving a lot of the technology around small-scale smart devices\n\n18:00 The ISM band is unregulated\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band \n\n19:15 New router uses a regulated frequency and hops off the frequency when it\u2019s being used for emergency communications\n\n20:50 RADAR, how does it work?\n\n21:10 What are Phil\u2019s favorite letters?\n\n22:22 To learn more about RF, check out App Note 150\nhttp://www.keysight.com/main/editorial.jspx?cc=US&lc=eng&ckey=459160&id=459160&cmpid=zzfindappnote150  \n\n#RF #radiofrequency #radar #digital #electronics #wireless #radar #rfmeasurements #tutorial #rf101 #rfbasics #radio #iot #radar #GPS",

The Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) is described and demonstrated.  The two basic types of Phase Comparators/Detectors, often referred to as Type I and Type II, are described and demonstrated.  Then, the overall operation of the PLL is demonstrated.  The addition of a simple divide-by-2 is shown, and how this is used to double the output frequency of the VCO, the basis for frequency synthesis.  Finally, the operation of the phase detectors is demonstrated a little further by purposely injecting an offset into the feedback loop to show how the loop compensates for this offset.

            "description": "Discover how a crystal set radio works and some of the hints and tips in building them.\n\nCrystal radios were used in the early days of radio broadcasting. They used crystal detectors that were known as Cat\u2019s Whiskers because of the thin wire that was placed onto the crystal itself. These radios required no batteries, all the power for the earphones coming from the signal that was received.\n\nThis video describes how the tuning and selectivity of the crystal radio works. It shows how the tuning capacitor and inductor may be changed to tune in different stations. It then describes the detection of amplitude modulated signals. It shows how a diode detector works. Finally it mentions the transducer and why only headphones are normally suitable for use with crystal radio sets.\n\nThe basic principles used within crystal radio sets are also employed in other more sophisticated radios, but this demonstrates how the basic radio principles work.\n\nThe video then provides some useful practical hints and tips about building and using crystal radio sets.\n\n\nMore information can be found on our crystal radio pages: https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/radio/radio-receivers/how-does-crystal-radio-work.php\n\nWebsite: https://www.electronics-notes.com\n\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe to the ElectronicsNotes YouTube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5v6V19CtjoeFzuiiEQpRg",

            "description": "The diode detector has been used for many years for detecting or demodulation signals using amplitude modulation, AM. The AM diode detector offers simplicity and low cost. The circuit for the AM diode detector uses a diode, capacitor and a load resistor which is often the volume control for the audio stages.\n\nThe video looks at the characteristics of a diode and how this can be used to rectify the amplitude modulated signal to recover the audio. The way in which the detection or demodulation process operates is shown in an easy to understand fashion.\n\nThe AM diode detector circuit is also used as a peak detector for RF signals where again its simplicity is a great advantage.\n\nIn the video we also look at what amplitude modulation is: how the amplitude of the signal varies in line with the modulating audio signal.\n\nAmplitude modulation is mainly used for broadcasting on the long, mediaum and short wave bands. It has been used since the beginning of the twentieth century and is still in use today.\n\nMore information can be found at: https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/radio/modulation/am-diode-detector-demodulator.php\n\nAssociated website: https://www.electronics-notes.com\n\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe to the ElectronicsNotes YouTube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5v6V19CtjoeFzuiiEQpRg",

            "description": "In this video we look at what phase noise is and how it affects other radio systems. The video then looks at specifying phase noise and then how to measure phase noise with a spectrum analyser.\n\nPhase noise is a very important aspect on signals as it can result in interference to other users, a degradation in bit error rate performance and other issues like reciprocal mixing.\n\nIn order to be able to improve the phase noise performance of any signal source, out is necessary to be able to measure the phase noise level. Measuring phase noise can be most easily achieved using a spectrum analyser. Knowing how to measure phase noise with a spectrum analyser is important as it enables the most accurate measurements to be made.\n\nThis video are also useful practical hints and tips on measuring phase noise. With levels of noise being very low, it is easy to introduce inaccuracies.\n\n\nMore information can be found at: https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/test-methods/spectrum-analyzer/how-to-measure-phase-noise-with-spectrum-analyzer.php\n\nAssociated website: https://www.electronics-notes.com\n\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe to the ElectronicsNotes YouTube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5v6V19CtjoeFzuiiEQpRg",

            "description": "This video provides the essential insights into understanding PLLs, Phase Locked Looks and how they work, giving a very understandable summary of the techniques and technologies used.\n\nPhase locked loops are used in many radio frequency of RF systems. Phase locked loops are used in radios, as FM detectors as well as within frequency synthesizers that form the local oscillator within radio receivers.\n\nThese and very many other applications mean that phase locked loops, PLLs are a key building block within a variety of radio and RF systems.\n\nA phase locked loop consists of a phase detector, voltage controlled oscillator and a loop filter as well as a reference signal source.\n\nWithin the phase locked loop, the incoming reference hits the phase detector along with a signal from the PLL voltage controlled oscillator. A signal proportional to the phase difference between the two is generated and this is passed through a loop filter to remove unwanted signals. The resulting error signal is applied to the input of the voltage controlled oscillator with the effect that the phase between the reference and the VCO signals is reduced.\n\nEventually a point is reached where a steady fixed phase difference exists. At this point the phase lock loop is said to be in lock and the frequency of the reference and VCO are exactly the same.\n\nUsing the basic phase locked loop, it is possible to achieve a wide variety of functions, but possibly they are most widely known for their use in frequency synthesizers. Here they enable a single highly stable frequency source to be used to generate a host of other frequencies, all with the same accuracy as the reference.\n\nThis phase locked loop tutorial gives all the basics required for an understanding of PLL technology.\n\nMore information can be found at:  https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/radio/pll-phase-locked-loop/tutorial-primer-basics.php\n\nAssociated website: https://www.electronics-notes.com\n\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe to the ElectronicsNotes YouTube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5v6V19CtjoeFzuiiEQpRg",

            "description": "Operational amplifiers are used in many circuits - one of the main applications is in amplifiers. Here the operational amplifier gain is of key importance.\n\nAlthough there are both inverting and non-inverting amplifiers which have their own calculations, there is a generic equation for these circuits. The generic formula can be used to develop the equations for the inverting and non-inverting configurations.\n\nThe gain of these operational amplifier circuits is governed by the level of negative feedback. Applying negative feedback provides a defined level of gain, wider bandwidth, lower distortion as well as a number of other advantages. However it is often the operational amplifier gain that is of major importance.\n\nWhen looking at the inverting amplifier circuit, the equation for the circuit can be calculated from the simple formula Av = R2/R1.\n\nFor the non-inverting amplifier the gain is slightly different and can be calculated from the formula Av = 1+ (R2/R1).\n\nIt is also possible to use the non-inverting amplifier as a buffer amplifier with a unity voltage gain by looping the output back to the inverting input, i.e. R1 = infinity and R2 = zero. In this way the voltage gain can be calculated to be 1.\n\nSo in summary both inverting and non-inverting amplifier gain is easy to calculate using the simple formulas.\n\nMore information can be found at: https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/analogue_circuits/operational-amplifier-op-amp/gain-equations.php\n\nCheck out my online shop: https://electronics-notes-shop.fourthwall.com\n\nAlso subscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://youtube.com/ElectronicsNotes",

            "title": "Operational Amplifier Slew Rate | Op Amp Slew Rate",
            "description": "The slew rate of an operational amplifier or op amp is particularly important. If the circuit is to perform correctly, then the slew rate for the amplifier must not be exceeded.\n\nOperational amplifier slew rate is a specification that is seen in virtually all op amp data sheets. It is the maximum voltage change that the amplifier can provide at its output. Typically it is measured in volts per microsecond, although some very fast amplifiers may have specifications measured in volts per picosecond.\n\nThe slew rate of an operational amplifier is limited by a number of factors, however the main one is results from the use of frequency compensation circuitry within the op-amp itself. The internal circuits can only provide a certain amount of current to change the voltage at this point and therefore the rate of voltage change is limited.\n\nThe slew rate limitations can cause the output waveform to be distorted if the maximum rate of change is exceeded. A square wave may have its sides skewed, and a sine wave can become distorted - in the limiting case it can even look more like a triangular wave as a result of slew rate.\n\nWhen designing a circuit, it is essential that the maximum slew rate specification is not exceeded. This can be done by looking at the signal frequency components and their peak voltages. The slew rate required can be calculated from the formula 2 pi f V.\n\nMore information about slew rate can be found at: https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/analogue_circuits/operational-amplifier-op-amp/slew-rate.php\n\nWebsite: https://www.electronics-notes.com\n\nYouTube channel: https://YouTube.com/ElectronicsNotes",

The noise of the scope and probing system interferes with the ability to make accurate Vpp measurements.\n\nLimited offset in the scope makes it difficult to zoom in and fully use the dynamic range of a scope's ADC, thus further reducing the measurement accuracy. Attend this webinar to understand how to make better power integrity measurements using your existing oscilloscope, including various oscilloscope setting and probing techniques. See how FFT can be used to find and trigger on signals coupled onto the power rail. Learn what attributes to look for if considering a new oscilloscope for power integrity measurements.\n\n________________________________________\n\nThis webinar was recorded in partnership with Rohde & Schwarz https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/\n\n________________________________________\n\nFor more video training and free resources, such as white-papers and measurement guides, visit https://www.testforce.com/academy",

            "description": "The math of superposition and quantum states.\nMinutephysics channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics\nHelp fund future projects: https://www.patreon.com/3blue1brown\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant: https://brilliant.org/3b1b\nAn equally valuable form of support is to simply share some of the videos.\nSpecial thanks to these supporters: http://3b1b.co/light-quantum-thanks\n\nHuge thanks to my friend Evan Miyazono, both for encouraging me to do this project, and for helping me understand many things along the way.\n\nThis is a simple primer for how the math of quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of polarized light, relates to the math of classical waves, specifically classical electromagnetic waves.\n\nI will say, if you *do* want to go off and learn the math of quantum mechanics, you just can never have too much linear algebra, so check out the series I did at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab\n\nMistakes: As several astute commenters have pointed out, the force arrow is pointing the wrong way at 2:18.  Thanks for the catch!\n\n*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.\n\nWhat's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.\n\nBecause of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

You can define the spacing between elements, change the orientation of the antennas, and specify the layout of the array.\n\nAnalysis, Design, and Tuning\nAntenna Toolbox uses the method of moments to analyze antenna elements and arrays. You can compute port properties such as impedance, S-parameters, and voltage standing wave ratios (VSWR) to determine the resonance frequency of antennas or to study impedance matching conditions. In MIMO systems, you can estimate and simulate the effects of coupling between antenna elements by computing the multiport S-parameters of the antenna array.\n\nCurrent and charge distributions on the surface of an antenna can be computed at different frequencies and then visualized. You can also inspect and control the density of the mesh used for the analysis.\n\nThe electromagnetic field can be computed at any point in space and at any frequency and can be visualized in 3D or in 2D over different planes. The far-field radiation pattern can be used to design isolated antennas and antenna arrays, and you can estimate the effects of adjacent structures by computing the array pattern of antenna elements when embedded in an array.\n\nYou can excite an antenna with a voltage source at the feed point, or you can solve the receiving antenna problem and compute the scattering solution using a plane wave excitation. You can connect lumped RLC elements to the surface of an antenna to tune it and improve its resonance.\n\nYou can explore the design space and optimize antennas and arrays to fulfill system specifications. For example, you can use Optimization Toolbox\u2122 and Global Optimization Toolbox with Antenna Toolbox to design antennas and arrays with optimized patterns and matching characteristics. \n\nSystem Integration and Simulation\nAntenna and array analysis results can be used for the accurate end-to-end simulation of wireless transceivers from digital baseband to the antenna and back, including the effects of the transmission channel.\n\nAntenna Toolbox can be used with Phased Array System Toolbox\u2122 and Communications System Toolbox\u2122 for the design of radar and MIMO communications systems. The complex radiation pattern of antenna elements that are isolated or embedded within an array can be applied in the development of beam forming and beam steering algorithms. With Antenna Toolbox, you can estimate the coupling between antenna elements, account for the edge effects of an array, and simulate MIMO channel performance, including antenna correlation.\n\nThe impedance and S-parameters of antennas and antenna arrays computed with Antenna Toolbox can be used for the design of matching networks using RF Toolbox\u2122. The effects of the antenna loading on power transfer and signal-to-noise ratio in the RF front-end can be incorporated into the simulation of wireless communication systems using RF Blockset\u2122.\n\nRF Propagation\nWith Antenna Toolbox, you can visualize antenna sites for transmitters and receivers, inspect communication links, and compute coverage (signal strength), using propagation models for free space, weather, and more.\n\nYou can use map-based visualization tools to analyze different scenarios for radar and base station positioning while accounting for the Earth\u2019s curvature on interactive geographical maps.",

This will allow you to make a permanent version of your project without using up one of your precious Arduino boards. \n\nThe ATmega328 is the microcontroller chip at the heart of the Arduino Uno. It is available in several packages, we will focus on the common 28-pin DIP (Dual Inline Package).\n\nYou only need a handful of components to turn an ATmega328 chip into a fully-functional Arduino Uno equivalent. It\u2019s much cheaper and a lot smaller, allowing you to build a permanent version of your design onto a small circuit board.\n\nI will also show you three methods of programming the ATmega328 chip, after all an Arduino isn\u2019t very useful if you can\u2019t upload a sketch to it!\n\nTo illustrate my point I will put together a very simple yet cute \u201cmusic box\u201d using an Arduino Uno, and then we\u2019ll move the project onto an ATmega328. It will be of particular interest to Star Wars fans as the \u201cmusic box\u201d plays \u201cThe Imperial March\u201d. If you have an old Darth Vader or Storm Trouper toy it would be neat to build it into it!\n\nI cannot take any credit for the sketch I used to create the Star Wars music box, the code was written by Nick Sort about 6 years ago and is available on GitHub - https://gist.github.com/nicksort/4736535 . It\u2019s an excellent example of making simple music with the Arduino.\n\nHere is the Table of Contents for this video:\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n03:29 - The ATmega328\n05:50 - Star Wars Arduino Project\n08:35 - Star Wars Sketch\n15:14 - Build an \u201cArduino\u201d with ATmega328\n21:31 - Loading the Program - Using Arduino Method 1\n24:50 - Loading the Program - Using Arduino Method 2\n30:01 - Loading the Program - Using FTDI Adapter\n\nAs always you will find an accompanying article for this video on the DroneBot Workshop website. \n\nAnd while you are there please sign up for my newsletter using this link - https://dbot.ws/dbnews. \n\nAnd a special thank you for all of your support in 2018.

Many vehicles are now controlled from mobile devices over GSM and the web, while even more can be unlocked and ignitions started from wireless keyfobs over RF.

The best rule of thumb is that short signal paths are often unbalanced, but longer paths are always balanced.\n\nUnbalanced Audio is seen most often in consoles, signal processing units, small stereo systems and consumer audio equipment. On stage it's used in guitar and keyboard signal chains where shorter cable lengths are used.  \n\nUnbalanced cable consists of one positive lead, surrounded by a ground. The signal travels down the positive lead while the ground absorbs most interference. \n\nBalanced audio is more applicable in professional studios or live venues where longer cable runs are required. \n\nBalanced cables consist of a  positive lead, a negative lead, and a ground. The positive and negative leads both carry audio. The negative carries the signal in opposite polarity to the positive lead. Both leads will pick up interference, but since the negative is opposite polarity of the positive, the interference is canceled out. The ground serves as extra protection from unwanted interference. \n\nBalanced is more commonly used in professional applications for several reasons.\n\nFirst, balanced cable can be run for longer lengths than unbalanced. the preferred cable length for unbalanced is only 10 ft, while the maximum cable length for balanced is 1000 ft. \n\nSecond, Balanced cable often has a cleaner signal as the interference is cancelled out.",

            "description": "For helpful Church Technology resources check out\nEllisProMedia.com\nwww.facebook.com/EllisProMedia\nwww.instagram.com/ellispromedia\n\nIn this video we are going to learn about console signal flow. Please check out our other church technology videos available at academyav.com \n\nIn this video we are going to learn about signal flow. Signal flow is the path that the audio signal takes from the input to the output in an audio console. \n\nThe signal first enters the console through an input. An input is usually a balanced signal that enters at mic level. Sometimes the signal may enter at line level which is 50dB higher than mic level. \n\nThe input passes the signal to the PreAmp which is controlled by the gain. The preamp and gain raise the signal to the correct amplitude to pass through the console.\n\nThe signal then passes to the on-board dynamics. This includes your compressor, gate, limiter, EQ, expander, and de-esser.\n\nThe PFL or Pre Fader Listen is used to solo a channel for listen only in the monitor headphones.\n\nThe signal then passes to a channel fader, which is used to adjust that channel's specific level during live mixing.\u00a0Unlike gain, which is set at the beginning and held constant through the mix, the fader is used for fine tune adjustments during mixing. \n\nThen signal passes through the pan, which can change the placement of the channel from left to right in a stereo mix. It also passes through a mute, which can turn off the entire signal.\u00a0\n\nAfter the pan and mute, the signal moves to the left and right bus where it is joined, or \"mixed\", with the signal from all other channels. this is also called the main bus.\u00a0A bus is a mix down of several channels.\n\nAfter all the channels have been mixed, the level of the left and right bus is controlled by the Master Fader before the signal is outputted from the console.\n\nOnce the signal from the left and right bus have passed through the master fader, the signal is then sent to the main outputs of the console to be sent to the speaker system. \n\nThere are several side paths your signal can take from the main path as well. So let's jump back to the preamp. After the preamp comes the insert where the signal can be routed through an external effect. If there is nothing plugged into the insert the signal will bypass it. \n\nAlso at this point, the signal may be routed through a Pre Aux Send. The Pre Aux send passes the signal of all selected channels to the Pre Aux Bus. which can be routed to stage monitors or in-ear monitors.\n\nAfter the Pre Aux Send comes the direct output. This is often used for multi-track recording or personal monitor systems. \n\nSometimes the signal is also routed through a Post Aux Send which comes after the channel fader and routes to the Post Aux Bus.\u00a0The Post Aux Bus is used to send multiple channels to the effects. Common effects include reverb and delay. \nThe effects are then routed to an effect return that sends the signal back to the left and right bus.\u00a0\n\nThanks for joining me today and please check out our other church technology resources available at academyav.com.",

The conceptual schematic of a Class-B amplifier is presented which leads to the introduction of Class-AB amplifier circuit to overcome the 'dead-zone' impairment of a push-pull Class-B design. To further improve the Class-AB amplifier and lower its input impedance, a final Class-A followed by Class-AB amplifier is presented  The component parameters are calculated and the schematics is explained in detail. All circuits are then implemented on a breadboard and tested both in the time domain and frequency domain.

            "description": "In this episode Shahriar takes a look at one of the most advanced electrical test and measurement instruments ever created. The Keysight UXR-Series Real-Time Oscilloscope brings 110GHz of analog bandwidth and 256GS/s real-time sampling at 4-channels simultaneously. To make it even more impressive, the entire data-conversion architecture is in 10-bits. This implies that the instruments captures, processes, stores and displays over 10Tb/s of information.\n\nVarious architectures of state-of-the art oscilloscopes from Keysight, LeCroy and Tektronix are examined and compared against the new real-time architecture of the UXR-Series oscilloscope. The teardown of the front-end 110GHz module along with the data acquisition board is presented and analyzed in detail. The instrument showcases a wide range of Keysight technologies implemented in various technologies such as InP, SiGe BiCMOS, 65nm CMOS and 28nm CMOS nodes. In combination with Hyper-Cube memory module, data can be captured at 256GS/S from all 4-channels at the same time. Several variants of the UXR-Series oscilloscope will be available from 13GHz to 110GHz bandwidths.\n\nA new calibration probe is also introduced based on the Keysight InP process capable of producing signal edges with sub-3.5ps of rise/fall times with NIST traceable calibration data. This enables users to perform NIST alignment and bandwidth calibration on site without needing to send the instrument back to Keysight.\n\nSeveral measurements with the scope demonstrates its extraordinarily low noise floor, jitter as well as the capability of the new probe module for instrument calibration. The 110GHz 4-channel variant of the UXR-Series oscilloscope has an MSRP of over $2 Million US dollars in 2024.\n\nThe Signal Path\nwww.TheSignalPath.com\nwww.YouTube.com/TheSignalPath\nwww.Patreon.com/TheSignalPath",

After a few measurements, it is concluded that the LO Synthesizer module is faulty. The module is presented in detail and various components and signal paths are identified. Extensive measurements are carried out until the fault is traced to problems in the varactor bank of the main VCO. After the component replacement, the instrument is fully functional.

However, in zero span mode they can also be used to measure in the time domain and show power as a function of time.  Time domain power measurements are important for quantifying time-varying power, such as that found in signals that are pulsed or bursted, which is common in many applications (radar, etc.)  This video shows how to configure and make time domain power measurements using a Rohde & Schwarz FSW series signal and spectrum analyzer.\n\nLearn more about Rohde & Schwarz Signal and Spectrum Analyzers: https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/products/test-and-measurement/signal-and-spectrum-analyzers_63665.html?mid=13799&midx=yt-tmfundamentals-signalspectrumanalyzers-productpage_____\n\nDownload the Spectrum Analyzer Fundamentals Educational Note: https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/products/test-and-measurement/analyzers/signal-spectrum-analyzers/spectrum-analyzer-fundamentals_253351.html?mid=13799&midx=yt-tmfundamentals-signalspectrumanalyzers-edunote_____\n\nTimeline:\n00:00 Introduction\n00:16 Suggested viewing\n00:37 Time domain power measurements on the FSW\n01:32 Starting time domain power measurements\n01:50 Time domain power measurement main screen\n02:14 About triggering\n03:16 Using limits to define evaluation range\n03:57 Time domain power measurement results\n04:34 About standard deviation\n05:20 Measuring \u201con\u201d periods vs. \u201coff\u201d periods\n06:04 Summary",
