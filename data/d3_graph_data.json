      "description": "RF system design is fundamentally governed by parameters such as Link Budget analysis, which calculates the total gain and loss from transmitter to receiver to ensure adequate Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) or Bit Error Rate (BER) for reliable communication. Key electrical specifications include transmit power (EIRP/ERP), receiver sensitivity (minimum detectable signal), noise figure (NF), and dynamic range, all of which directly impact the achievable communication distance and data rate. Other critical factors involve frequency allocation, channel bandwidth, antenna gain and pattern, and regulatory compliance (e.g., FCC, ETSI limits) concerning spurious emissions and maximum power output, defining the practical and legal boundaries of the system's performance.",

Open loop gain is usually exceedingly high; in fact, an ideal operational amplifier has infinite open-loop gain. Typically an op-amp may have an open-loop gain of around 100,000. Normally, feedback is applied around the op-amp so that the gain of the overall circuit is defined and kept to a figure which is more usable. However the very high gain of the op-amp enables considerable levels of feedback to be applied to achieve required performance. The open-loop gain of an operational amplifier falls very rapidly with increasing frequency. Along with slew rate, this is one of the reasons why operational amplifiers have limited bandwidth. P",
