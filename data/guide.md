To make the guide easy to update, you should separate its content from the code.

-Create guide.md: Save the final, refined Markdown content from Phase 1 into a new file named guide.md in your project's root directory.

-Convert to HTML: Before deploying or when you update the guide, use an online converter or a script to convert the contents of guide.md into HTML.

-Paste into index.html: Paste the generated HTML directly inside the <div id="help-modal-body"></div> element.
