# RF Mind Map Visualizer

An **interactive web-based visualization tool** for exploring structured knowledge in **RF communications** and related engineering domains.
It renders a **mind map** from CSV datasets describing topics, their relationships, and associated multimedia resources (e.g., YouTube links).

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Dynamic Mind Map Visualization**
  Built with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), the app displays interconnected RF topics as an explorable graph.

* **Contextual Details Panel**
  Clicking a topic or relationship opens a side panel showing:

  * Descriptions and key concepts
  * Related topics and their relation types
  * Linked YouTube resources with thumbnails

* **Data-Driven Structure**
  Topics, links, and URLs are loaded directly from CSV files located in the `data/` directory.

* **Offline & Client-Side**
  Entirely browser-based ‚Äî no backend required.
  Data editing (e.g., adding URLs) is done by re-generating and downloading updated CSVs.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**

   * `topics.csv`: hierarchical list of RF topics
   * `links.csv`: defines cross-topic relations (e.g., *depends on*, *extends*)
   * `urls.csv`: connects topics/links to videos or web resources

2. **Visualization**

   * Open `src/index.html` in a browser
   * The app loads data from `/data/`
   * Interactive D3.js graph is generated dynamically

3. **URL Enrichment (Optional)**

   * `scripts/enrich_urls.py` uses **Gemini AI** + **YouTube Data API**
   * It reads YouTube playlists and matches videos to topics automatically
   * Generates/updates `urls.csv` with best-matching resources

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/rf-mindmap.git
cd rf-mindmap
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file (based on `.env.example`) and add:

```
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### 4. Run Scripts (Optional)

* **Check Model Limits**

  ```bash
  python scripts/check_limits.py
  ```
* **Estimate Token Usage**

  ```bash
  python scripts/calculate_tokens.py
  ```
* **Enrich URLs Automatically**

  ```bash
  python scripts/enrich_urls.py
  ```

## üåê Using the Visualizer

1. Open `src/index.html` in your browser.
2. Explore the mind map ‚Äî click on nodes or links to view details.
3. Modify data files in `/data/` to expand or update the graph.
4. Use the ‚ÄúSave & Download urls.csv‚Äù button to export updated data.
